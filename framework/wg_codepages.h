/**
	Static class containing code pages for tanslating 8-bit characters from various
	encodings to unicode.
	
	These code pages are used by WgCharSeq8, which provides a convenient way of reading
	text in various legacy encodings, but can also be accessed directly.

	The code pages are simply static arrays of 256 16-bit entries each, where each
	entry contains the unicode number for the 8-bit character corresponding
	to the array index.
